# nand2tetris
11th Grade

All of my projects and code from the nand2tetris course that uses
the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Nisan and Schocken, 
MIT Press. These were all coded in my junior year of high school
from 2021-2022. The purpose of this course is to "build" a computer
from start to finish, including its hardware (emulated in the first
few projects) and software (programmed using python in order to translate 
from the high-level jack language down to binary in multiple steps).
